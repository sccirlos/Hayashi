## Part of Covid-19 project: Help local RGV restaurants by replacing restaurant menus with QR codes
Creating a wesbite with Hayashi Japanese Steakhouse menus [McAllen, TX] 

Many restaurants do have websites, but their sites are not convienient to quickly show the customer the menus. I am creating simple templates for restaurants to use. 

Hayashi is the first so template is from scratch.
